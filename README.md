# MorseTranslator

Welcome to the Morse Code Translator. It's a simple page with which you are able to encode ASCII characters to Morse Code and vice versa.

In order for this to work you have to start the page on a local server. I recommend using an extension like [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) if you are using vscode.
